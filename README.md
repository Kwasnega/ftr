## 🎓 **Academic Project Context**

### **C++ Foundation**
This web application serves as the **graphical user interface demonstration** of our C++ Financial Tracker developed for our Computer Science course. The core financial algorithms, data structures, and business logic were originally implemented in C++ for terminal-based operation.

### **Web GUI Purpose**
- **Visual Demonstration** - Shows how the C++ terminal application would look with a modern interface
- **Feature Showcase** - All web features correspond to C++ functionality
- **User Experience** - Demonstrates the same multi-user system, transaction management, budget tracking, and investment portfolio features
- **Academic Excellence** - Bridges traditional programming concepts with modern web development

### **Technical Bridge**
- **Same Data Models** - User accounts, transactions, investments, and budgets mirror C++ structures
- **Identical Logic** - Financial calculations and algorithms match C++ implementation
- **Feature Parity** - Every web feature has a corresponding C++ function
- **Educational Value** - Shows progression from console application to web interface
